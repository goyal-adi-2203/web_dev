    <p style="width: 50%">
      Akatsuki (暁, literally meaning: "Dawn" or "Daybreak") was a group of
      shinobi that existed outside the usual system of hidden villages. Over the
      course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and was led by
      different individuals. Though each iteration is viewed as either
      subversives or criminals, all seek to make the world a better place
      through their own means. Each Akatsuki tended to have multiple lairs
      across the world, inaccessible either due to their remoteness or the
      various security measures that protected them.

      Team 7 was a Konohagakure team formed under the leadership of Kakashi
      Hatake. Two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha left the village, Kakashi
      filled out paperwork to form Team Kakashi, with his former pupils Naruto
      Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno now being treated as equals alongside their
      teacher. Following Yamato and Sai joining the team, the group went by Team
      Yamato during the former's leadership.

      The Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist (霧の忍刀七人衆, Kiri no
      Shinobigatana Shichinin Shū) was an organisation consisting of only the
      greatest blade-wielding shinobi of their generation that Kirigakure can
      produce. There can only be seven members at a time — hence the name. The
      swords of the Seven Swordsmen are passed down from generation to
      generation[1] since the First Mizukage's era. They're considered mystical
      blades, and together, the Seven Swordsmen are capable of bringing down an
      entire nation, regarded as being the strongest shinobi in the village
      behind the Mizukage.
